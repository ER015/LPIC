101 System Architecture
101.1 Determinate and Configure Hardware Settings

lspci - Shows all devices currently connected to the PCI(Peripheral Component Interconnect) bus.
lsusb - Lists USB devices currently connected to the machine.
lsmod - Shows all currently loaded modules.
modprobe - Load and unload kernel modules. (unloading with  -r)
modinfo - shows a description, the file, the author, the license, identification, dependancies for the given module.
modinfo -p  - will make modinfo display all available parameters and ignore the other information.

/etc/modprobe.conf - file for made persistant customized parameters of module
			or include them in the individual files with extention.conf in the directory /etc/modprobe.d
/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf - block loading of causing problems module.

Information files and device files 
/proc, /sys, /dev  - pseudo filesystems, only exists when the system is running.
/proc - files with information regarding running processes and hardware resources.
/proc/cpuinfo - Lists detailed information about the CPU
/proc/interrupts - A list of numbers of the interrupts per IO (INPUT/OUTPUT) device for each cpu.
/proc/ioports  - List currentl registered INPUT/OUTPUT ports regions in use.
/proc/dma - List the registered DMA(direct memory access) channels in use.

/sys - Files inside the /sys directory have similar roles to those in /proc. However the /sys directory has the specific purpose 
of storing device information and kernel data related to hardware, while /proc also contains information about various kernel data 
structures including running processes and configuration.

/dev - Another directory directly related to devices in system is /dev. Every file in /dev is associated with a system device, 
particulary storage devices for example IDE hard dive when connected to the motherboard s first IDE channel, is represented by the file
/dev/hda. Every partition in this disk will be identified by /dev/hda1, /dev/hda2.

UDEV - The Udev is responsible for the identification and configuration of device while the system is running(hotplug detect) and
device alredy presented during powerup(coldplug detect). Udev relies on sysfs, the pseudo filesystem mounted in /sys.
As new device are detected, udev searches for a matching rule in the predefined rules sored in directory
/etc/udev/rules.d/

Storage Devices - In Linus storage devices represented as block devices, because data is read to and from these devices in blocks
of bufferd data with different sizes and positions. Every block device is identified by a file in the /dev directory, with the name
of the file depending on the device type and its partition.
